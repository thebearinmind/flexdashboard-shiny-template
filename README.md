# flexdashboard-shiny-template

Template for RMarkdown shiny flexdashboard. 

If you do not require any specific customization, it is easier to use flexdashboard template for shiny dashboards, rather than writing your custom r shiny script.

Have a look at the RMarkdown template which includes some basic ggplot visualisations as well as heatmap created using leaflet package. Feel free to further alter it according to your needs.
